# neural_network_facedetection
3 layer neural network for facial detection. all layers are fully connected. stochastic gradient descent was used for training\
dataset-CMU Face Images Data Set from uci repository\
regularization was used to prevent overfitting\
a validation set was used to control number of iterations
